# Technical Debt Is Not Free

## Abstract
Technical debt is a silent killer in software development, often accumulating unnoticed until it causes significant issues. Even mature teams that recognize and document technical debt can struggle if they don’t take action. Just as ignoring financial debt can lead to severe consequences, ignoring technical debt can have equally severe consequences. In this session, we will explore the concept of technical debt, providing practical strategies for documenting, tracking, and effectively addressing it. Attendees will learn to identify technical debt early, prioritize it, and implement solutions to prevent it from derailing projects. By the end of this session, you’ll have a clear roadmap for managing technical debt and ensuring your projects remain on track.

## Short Abstract
Technical debt can accumulate silently in software development, leading to severe issues if left unaddressed. This session explores practical strategies for documenting, tracking, and addressing technical debt. Attendees will learn to identify, prioritize, and implement solutions to manage technical debt effectively, ensuring projects stay on track and on schedule. By the end, you’ll have a clear roadmap for handling technical debt and preventing it from derailing your work.
